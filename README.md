**`Computer Scientist and Mathematician`**

I am currently a freshman at SUNY Stony Brook, studying Computer Science, Applied Mathematics and Statistics.
My interests in math are currently:
- Number Theory
- Probability
- Combinatorics

After completing my undergraduate studies, I plan to pursue a PhD in mathematics, computer science, or maybe even physics!

Through CS and math, I hope to create solutions that uplift humanity. But beyond technology, I want to bring hope and spread kindness as a person.

In my free time, I enjoy watching soccer, sitcoms, or sometimes even anime!
I also occasionally play video games, such as Minecraft or Gacha games on my phone :D


**`Manchester United is the best football club in the world`**
